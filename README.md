# Fashion-Recommender-System
A deep-learning–based fashion recommendation system that suggests visually similar clothing items using image embeddings.
The system uses CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) feature extraction, vector similarity, and a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.

Features
  Image-based similarity search
  Feature extraction using:
      Custom CNN
      CLIP model
  Fast retrieval using precomputed embeddings
  User interface implemented with Streamlit
  Dataset of fashion images included
  Modular and easy-to-extend codebase

How It Works
  The system loads precomputed embeddings (pkl files).
  User uploads a fashion image.
  The model extracts the feature vector.
  Finds the closest embeddings using cosine similarity.
  Displays the top recommended similar items.

Models Used
  CNN-based feature extractor (pretrained)
  OpenAI CLIP (image encoder)
